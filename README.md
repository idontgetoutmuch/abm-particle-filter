This project models a flu outbreak in a boarding school using a SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model.
This was achieved using through an Agent Based Model (ABM) in Julia.

To run the current updated model, open the Jupyter notebook titled "SIR model for boarding school data.ipynb" and run this script.
