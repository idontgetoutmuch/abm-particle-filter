abstract = {In this work, we implement approximate Bayesian computational methods to improve the design of a wound-healing assay used to quantify cell–cell interactions. This is important as cell–cell interactions, such as adhesion and repulsion, have been shown to play a role in cell migration. Initially, we demonstrate with a model of an unrealistic experiment that we are able to identify model parameters that describe agent motility and adhesion, given we choose appropriate summary statistics for our model data. Following this, we replace our model of an unrealistic experiment with a model representative of a practically realisable experiment. We demonstrate that, given the current (and commonly used) experimental set-up, our model parameters cannot be accurately identified using approximate Bayesian computation methods. We compare new experimental designs through simulation, and show more accurate identification of model parameters is possible by expanding the size of the domain upon which the experiment is performed, as opposed to increasing the number of experimental replicates. The results presented in this work, therefore, describe time and cost-saving alterations for a commonly performed experiment for identifying cell motility parameters. Moreover, this work will be of interest to those concerned with performing experiments that allow for the accurate identification of parameters governing cell migratory processes, especially cell migratory processes in which cell–cell adhesion or repulsion are known to play a significant role.},

@book{Lima2021,
abstract = {Hybrid multiscale agent-based models (ABMs) are unique in their ability to simulate individual cell interactions and microenvironmental dynamics. Unfortunately, the high computational cost of modeling individual cells, the inherent stochasticity of cell dynamics, and numerous model parameters are fundamental limitations of applying such models to predict tumor dynamics. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a coarse-grained twoscale ABM (cgABM) with a reduced parameter space that allows for an accurate and efficient calibration using a set of time-resolved microscopy measurements of cancer cells grown with different initial conditions. The multiscale model consists of a reaction-diffusion type model capturing the spatio-temporal evolution of glucose and growth factors in the tumor microenvironment (at tissue scale), coupled with a lattice-free ABM to simulate individual cell dynamics (at cellular scale). The experimental data consists of BT474 human breast carcinoma cells initialized with different glucose concentrations and tumor cell confluences. The confluence of live and dead cells was measured every three hours over four days. Given this model, we perform a time-dependent global sensitivity analysis to identify the relative importance of the model parameters. The subsequent cgABM is calibrated within a Bayesian framework to the experimental data to estimate model parameters, which are then used to predict the temporal evolution of the living and dead cell populations. To this end, a moment-based Bayesian inference is proposed to account for the stochasticity of the cgABM while quantifying uncertainties due to limited temporal observational data. The cgABM reduces the computational time of ABM simulations by 93% to 97% while staying within a 3% difference in prediction compared to ABM. Additionally, the cgABM can reliably predict the temporal evolution of breast cancer cells observed by the microscopy data with an average error and standard deviation for live and dead cells being 7.61±2.01 and 5.78 ±1.13, respectively.},

@article{Rocha2021,
abstract = {Hypoxia is a critical factor in solid tumors that has been associated with cancer progression and aggressiveness. We recently developed a hypoxia fate mapping system to trace post-hypoxic cells within a tumor for the first time. This approach uses an oxygen-dependent fluorescent switch and allowed us to measure key biological features such as oxygen distribution, cell proliferation, and migration. We developed a computational model to investigate the motility and phenotypic persistence of hypoxic and post-hypoxic cells during tumor progression. The cellular behavior was defined by phenotypic persistence time, cell movement bias, and the fraction of cells that respond to an enhanced migratory stimulus. This work combined advanced cell tracking and imaging techniques with mathematical modeling, to reveal that a persistent invasive migratory phenotype that develops under hypoxia is required for cellular escape into the surrounding tissue, promoting the formation of invasive structures (“plumes”) that expand toward the oxygenated tumor regions.},

This article presents this class of methods and a number of recent advances, with the goal of helping statisticians assess the applicability and usefulness of these methods for their purposes. Our presentation emphasizes the role of bridging distributions for computational and statistical purposes.

Unlike most other approaches to population calibration, our method produces uncertainty quantification on the estimated distribution. Furthermore, the method can be applied to any population calibration problem, regardless of whether the model of interest is deterministic or stochastic, or whether the population data is observed with or without measurement error. We demonstrate the method on several examples, including one with real data. We also discuss the computational limitations of the approach. Immediate applications for the methodology developed here exist in many areas of medical research including cancer, COVID-19, drug development and cardiology.},
