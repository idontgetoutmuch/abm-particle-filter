# abm-particle-filter

This project models a flu outbreak in a boarding school using a SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model. Additionally, a predator-prey system with Koalas and Eucalyptus is also modelled. These models were achieved through utilising Agent Based Models (ABM) in Julia.

To run the current updated model:
  SIR: Open the Jupyter notebook titled "SIR model for boarding school data.ipynb" and run this script. 
  SIR particle filter: open and run "flu_tidy.jl"
  Koalas particle filter: open and run "pf_koalas.jl"
